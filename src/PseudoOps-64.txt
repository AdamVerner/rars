# Templates that override 32 bit templates in the case that the 32 bit version doesn't work
# This needs to be here because it should have priority over the other li's
li t1,-100     ;addi RG1, x0, VL2                ;#Load Immediate : Set t1 to 12-bit immediate (sign-extended)

# Please don't try to use LIX1 templates, they are pretty brittle and very specific to li
# This is a pretty complex template, but it is actually simpler than what gcc uses. gcc seems to actually optimize it per immediate.
